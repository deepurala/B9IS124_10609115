This is a completed hybrid mobile application for a basic chat use case. I have used the ionic platform to build this application. I have basically used 3 plugins here and explained as follows:
1. Screen Orientation
2. Keyboard: used in the conversation page
3. Vibration: used on the send message button/icon.

Also, I have desined a splash screen natively and added it at the application startup screen (hardcoded the duration to 3s). All the data seen in the application are static and are populated from the respective html files.
